## GRAOOM ##

(_what a terrific name for a game_)

GRAOOM is a temporary codename for a project that aims at creating a multiplayer hack'n'slash game, composed of a server and of a client. Perhaps later we'll add some tools such as a map editor, but that's not for now.

At that moment, the project is in development (and for several months) and there's no screen to show, or anything beautiful that could make you say "Wow, this project is really cool!", but be patient!
